# Analyzing Police Activity
## A DataCamp project
**Objective:** Explore the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyze the impact of gender on police behavior. During the course, you will gain more practice with:
- cleaning messy data
- creating visualizations
- combining and reshaping datasets
- manipulating time series data

Analyzing Police Activity with pandas will give you valuable experience analyzing a dataset from start to finish, preparing you for your data science career

Programming languages and libraries used: 
- python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

**Bonus Task:** Analyze the effect of weather on policing
- Use a second dataset to explore the impact of weather conditions on police behavior during traffic stops.
- Practice merging and reshaping datasets
- Assess whether a data source is trustworthy
- Work with categorical data
